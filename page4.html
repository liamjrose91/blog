<h1>Review</h1>

<h2>aassessment of IT tools used to create my site</h2>
<br>
<P>  Visual studio code and trello were more than capable 
    tools for the tasks we had to carry out,  lacking the 
    technical knowhow I was reluctant to change approach, 
    preferring to stick with the familiar rather than 
    stretching myself thin by having to learn how to 
    use other tools unnecessarily, given more time 
    I would love to be able to know all the available 
    options and weigh up my choices to enable me to 
    choose the best tool for the task at hand.</P>
    <br>
    <h2>Were the tools appropiate?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>  The tools provided are more than enough to 
        complete the tasks required, VS code allowed 
        for use of all the programming languages we 
        have learnt over the past 3 weeks, trello in 
        this instance could be used to call on others 
        for assistance if required or just to have 
        someone give your work a look ver if you’re 
        unsure, other than that trello’s best suited 
        to team efforts and this particular task is 
        conducted on an individual basis.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Strengths and weaknesses of my webpage</h2>
        <br>
        <p> My webpage is very basic as of right now, 
            due to time constraints and my lack of 
            familiarity of the macOS as well as all 
            the tools and websites we used took me longer 
            than most due ro said unfamiliarity and my eyesight problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Improvements i'd like to make to my webpage</h2>
            <br>
            <P>
                    There are a plethora of improvements I’d like 
                    to implement into my webpage, from css stying 
                    and flex box structuring, time has been an 
                    issue for me, also my technical knowhow isn’t 
                    at it’s best but I feel although I have come a 
                    long way, albeit a slow and arduous  process 
                    I feel although given time I will improve 
                    upon and acquire those skills.
                  </P>

                  <h2>Review of outcomes</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p> When putting my webpage together I took 
                      care to make sure I used fonts and colour 
                      that will allow even those with colour 
                      impairments and dyslexia could read, 
                      some font’s blend in to some people 
                      making it hard to read, aerial is a 
                      good font to use for this reason, it 
                      would be preferable to add colour 
                      options so visitors can select a 
                      colour scheme based upon their 
                      specific impairment, though this 
                      isn’t absolutely necessary since 
                      all browsers and operating systems 
                      have accessibility options inherently 
                      built in, these are ample but often 
                      clash with how sites have been designed, 
                      pulling the magnifier to places the user 
                      didn’t want to go for example.  Other than 
                      accommodating for those who require accessibility 
                      I would have liked to structure my sight in such a 
                      way that it is attractive to look at yet not too 
                      visually noisy with possibly some music playing in 
                      the background etc.  </p>
