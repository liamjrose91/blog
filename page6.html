     <h1>Content and design of webpage</h1>
<br>
<h2>layout of pages and content</h2>
<br>
<p>  I would like to structure my site in such a manner that 
    the screen isn’t too busy at any given time, a background 
    image with movement and eye catching colour would certainly 
    make it more visually pleasant but as of yet I haven’t 
    implemented any css styling due to time constraints, 
    each page would have featured relevant written and 
    visual content, such as backgrounds matching the 
    subject matter outlined in the text, maybe even 
    some sound content, a navigational bar would have 
    featured relevant images for each page as well as 
    a home button so the user can always return back 
    to the landing page of my site.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>copyright and patent laws</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Copyright and patent laws have to be considered 
        when sourcing content, permission will be 
        required for any content that is currently 
        the property of a individual or organisation.  
        There is plenty of content that isn’t claimed 
        like stock images and certain pieces of music etc, 
        it’s always wis to exercise caution and do some 
        research before using any content you aren’t 
        sure is under copyright.

        <h2>Accessability options and accomodating disabilities</h2>
        <br>
        <p>There are a whole host of disabilities people 
            face that present challenges, sites can be 
            developed to be more disability friendly than 
            others, being a frequent user of accessibility 
            settings I can gladly say it’s come a long 
            way, but like most things it isn’t perfect, 
            I find some sites have a tendency of using 
            features that wrestle control of the mouse 
            pointer which is tied to the operating 
            systems magnification option, this cause 
            the magnifier to jolt unexpectedly 
            disorientating the user and causing 
            unnecessary frustration.  Colour 
            schemes are important, make sure 
            you research known colour 
            impairment types and avoid 
            colour that clash.  Most 
            accessibility options are 
            operating system based so 
            it won’t be necessary to 
            code anything in unless 
            it’s innovative or aims 
            to accommodate already 
            existing options.</p>

            <h2>Utilising appropriate file types in html.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Internet file types are abundant, the appropriate 
                ones to use will entirely depend on what you 
                want to include in your digital project, 
                CSS (cascading stylesheet) is used to 
                compose the structural positioning/layout 
                of thee html site, .GIF (graphics 
                interchange format) is a simple 
                image file that can be used to 
                insert moving animated images 
                into your site to give it 
                a more attractive aesthetic, 
                .HTML/.HTM (hypertext markup 
                language file) most pages 
                you create will be in this 
                format, it appears as plain 
                text only so has to be used 
                in conjunction with .CSS 
                and other formats for the 
                extra features and content types.</p>
