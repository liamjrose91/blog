<br>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>The rise of information communication technology 
    has allowed businesses to streamline their services 
    so that they are able to respond to a customers requests and meet their needs much more quickly, 
    not having to dig through paper based (clerical) 
    system, instead searching the customers reference number and letting the computer do the locating, 
    allowing said business to increase productivity at a low cost, 
    this is known as customer relationship management(CRM). 
<br>
       <p> It has also allowed companies to do away with with clerical system, 
        again streamlining the companies ability to locate information very 
        quickly and effectively and at the same time freeing up space that 
        was once taken up by filing cabinets.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <br>
        <p>ICT systems offer plenty of cheap and effect communication tools such as vOIP(voice over internet protocol) 
            VOIPâ€™s are often free unlike their landline and mobile carrier counterparts. 
             The need to meet physically for conferences and meetings is no longer a necessity, 
             given that there are many video enabled communication services available that will 
             allow you to attend from anywhere in the world, location is no longer a barrier to
              those who have to travel abroad or great distances as part of their work.</p>
