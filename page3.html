<h1>Improving productivity with IT systems</h1>
<br>
<h2>Risks that could hinder didgital projects</h2>
<br>
<p> There are a multitude of risks involved with any type of work that is conducted in an online environment, 
    data can become corrupted, a server night go down or your security could be compromised, there are steps that
     can be taken to soften the blow of such setbacks, like backups for example.  Digital projects can fail due to 
     all sorts of reasons, it could be that the team had elaborate and intricate ideas for their project but were unable 
     to implement it due to lack of technical knowledge, lack of resources such as time or money, or maybe integral staff 
     members left a gaping hole in your skill sets, it is always wise to sum up all the variables to mitigate these potential 
     issues and constantly review project status and adjust accordingly.</p>
     <br>
     <h2> selecting and using IT systems
        and software</h2>
        <br>
        <p> When it comes to selecting the right tech and tools 
            for the job there are many aspects to consider,  
            whether or not the software allows use of the programming 
            language you intend to use and what features it has that 
            will improve upon efficiency and productivity ,when it comes to 
            source code editors VSC(visual studio code) accommodates the use of 
            many coding languages and is rich in features plus it’s cross compatible 
            with all systems, macos, windows and linux.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Effectiveness of selected tools and software</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Trello and github are great collaborative platforms, 
                allowing you to access your workload from anywhere 
                in the world given you have an internet connection, 
                my utilisation of these platforms was extremely limited, 
                using mainly as a means of passing information to colleges or 
                pushing to GitHub to access remotely from elsewhere, I can the 
                merit of these technologies despite not having used it to it’s full potential.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
                <br>
                <p>  The Eu general data protection regulation is the most important change 
                    to data privacy laws in 20 years, replacing the data protection directive 
                    95/46/Ec, it outlines how personal data ought to be handled by any company 
                    or organisation that holds it, those in violation. Of the new rules will fave 
                    hearty fines.  GDPR was put forward to unify the rules across Europe, to give 
                    people more say and transparency in how or when their data is used and to reshape 
                    how companies and organisations across the region approach privacy, one of the 
                    requirements was the ability for the user to download the information the organisation has regarding them.</p>
