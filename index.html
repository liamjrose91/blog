    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>welcome to my blog, fist off here's a lil somthing about who i am, 
        i grew up in a small town in cheshire called windford. i spent a lot of my childhood messing around on many dufferent consoles playing gsmes,
        i remember playing wolfenstein 3d on my uncle's windows pc, it was unlike any other game i had played, it blew my lil mind, computers remained a big part of my life mainly because of my love for gaming. </p>

        <p>as i grew older it became clear i had a problem, 
        my eyesight had began to deteriorate, the cause remained elusive for alomst a decade,
        i spent my esucational life being treated although i had leatning difficulties, 
        it's an unfortunate case, with the nature of my condition which is called "stargardt's disease"
         often goes undiagnosed until around mid teenage yeats.

        <p>given my eyesight had plummited to 20/200 in both eyes, i come to rely heavily on devices to help me see,
         from using my phone camera as a digital magnifier to using accessibility options on computers and games consoles, 
         if it wasn't for this technology my life would be a major pain in the ass!</p>
        </div>
        <br>spent my days soaking up whatever took my interest, psychology, philosphy, science, technology  history, politics or just current events, there are endless amounts of docum
        <h3>interests</h3>
        <p>being disabled in all i found mtself with a lot of time on my hands, thanks to the internet i could leap and bound through information, so i found myself taking a general interest in all manner of things, from psychology to  philosophy, theres a wealth of information out there, just gotta know how to sift through the bullshit! </p>
