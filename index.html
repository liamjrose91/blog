    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>welcome to my blog, fist off here's a lil somthing about who i am, 
        i grew up in a small town in cheshire called windford. i spent a lot of my childhood messing arounf playing gsmes,
        i remember olaying wolfenstein 3d on my uncle's windows 98 pc, having only experianced the sega megafrive's offerings that were pretty much exclusively platforming games,
        it opened my eyes to what these machines were capable of, as time went on it only got even more impressive, going from teams of a handful of nerds to requireing an entire army to make the video game epic's of today </p>
