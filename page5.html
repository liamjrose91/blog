<h1> Solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and
    systems </h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in
            terms of productivity and efciency </h2>
            <br>
            <P>There are many advantages when it comes 
                to IT systems and tools, they increase 
                productivity with features such as 
                intellisense, basically auto correct/predictive 
                text for programming languages allowing code to 
                be written faster with less potential for mistakes 
                to arise.  It systems also allow for consolidation 
                of relevant resources/materials that may need to be accessed 
                by others to aid them in completing digital projects, 
                collaborative technologies further improve on this by 
                delegating specific tasks to each member on a project, 
                keeping the team up to speed and allowing them to put 
                their focus where it is needed most.  The drawbacks 
                of such systems are certainly not out weighed by the 
                positives, no system is perfect and are liable to 
                malfunction at  any time, this is why it is wise to keep 
                backups of integral information.  Then Theresa the potential 
                for online attacks of all sorts or simple just a server 
                shutting down, these issues can always be rectified with 
                varying degrees of damage that will need to be addressed 
                in the fallout of any unfortunate mishaps.</P>

                <h2>Improving productivity and effciancy</h2>
                <br>
                <p>  Improving productivity and efficiency can decline 
                    if a workforce is overworked or understaffed, 
                    it’s a good idea to allow for down time during 
                    the work day so staff can relax the stress away, 
                    possibly plan activities that staff can attend on 
                    a regular basis, this is an especially good way 
                    to do it as it can aid in social cohesion 
                    amongst colleges, and if staff get along they’
                    ll cooperate more effectively.

                    <h2>solutions to improve upon my productivity in completeing digital projects</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> In regards to making my own website working 
                        as a team would certainly would had lightened 
                        the load and have it come to fruition quicker, 
                        but in this instance it’s supposed to be a 
                        personal blog so I think it best it came 
                        from the individual it’s about to retain 
                        their personality consistently throughout 
                        the content on the website, my own efficiency 
                        is improving as I become more familiar with 
                        the layout and features of all the tools and 
                        websites we have used so far.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Testing digital solutions</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>All digital projects should be screened 
                            for bugs and errors, quality assurance 
                            is important as you don’t want the end 
                            user’s first experience to be a buggy 
                            mess, and the client certainly wouldn’t 
                            be hiring you again if your standards 
                            aren’t up to scratch.  Testing html pages 
                            in a browser is quick and easy, just navigate 
                            through just as the end user would, fixing 
                            any spelling errors or navigational issues 
                            you find along the way, regarding the code itself, 
                            visual studio code its a great tool for finding 
                            errors in your code using the debug feature.</p>
